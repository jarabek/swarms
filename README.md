swarms
======

A JS swarm painting app, that I'm using largely as a project for learning <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>.

The swarms used in the app are a bit of a fake-out, as they don't actually follow any of the self guiding behaviours that are consistent with more traditional swarms (i.e. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">Boids</a>).
